summary: A personal summer project with the goal to design and build a robotic quadruped named Sparky. The dimensions are approximately that of the MIT mini cheetah, and much of the overarching design takes inspiration from that work. This design uses custom designed, machined, and assembled internal cycloidal actuators.

8/10 Would build again. Would have made fewer CNC parts.
