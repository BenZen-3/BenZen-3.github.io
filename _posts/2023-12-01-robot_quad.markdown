summary: My senior design project at Cornell with the goal to design and build a robotic quadruped named Sparky. The dimensions are approximately that of the MIT mini cheetah, and much of the overarching design takes inspiration from that work. This design uses custom designed, machined, and assembled internal cycloidal actuators.

This project was started in the summer of 2023 and most of the mechanical work was completed during that time. At the start of the semester in August 2023, a friend of mine, Sumair S, joined the project to help work on the controls and some of the electronics. My contributions for this project were: the custom cycloidal actuator design, development, and manufacturing, the selection and basic implmentation of core electronics, the leg and frame designs for the quad, and part of the simulation of the quad in MuJoCo. Sumair contributed greatly to the electronics implementation and the simulation of our walking wuad gaits. The senior design required a full write-up, so this page will house that document here.

8/10 Would build again. Would have made fewer CNC parts.
